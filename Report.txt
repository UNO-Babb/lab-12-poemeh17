Questions to answer:
1) What was the worst case scenario for any sorting technique?
The worst case scenario is Bubble Sort because it took the longest on the reverse sorting.

2) The first 3 sorts have the same runtime of O(n^2). Why were the times different? Why would one be more efficient than the others?
Bubble Sort does a lot of swapping, bubble sort exit is fast when the list is already sorted, and selection sort does fewer swaps.

3) Why was merge sort so much more efficient?
Merge sort is faster because it uses  far fewer comparisons.

4) The built-in sorting technique for most programming languages is known as TimSort.
This is a merge sort until the arrays have fewer than 10 elements, then it does an insertion sort. Why would this be useful?
This is useful because insertion sort is very fast on small or almost-sorted lists, and merge sort is fast on large lists, 
so combining them gives the best overall speed.

5) What issues can you see with a recursive sorting technique like merge sort?
Merge sort needs extra space to make new lists, and because it calls itself many times, 
it can run into problems if the list is very big
